# my_aes128_ip_coprocessor
This AES implementation is an asynchronous, combinational implementation in Verilog; the module implements the encryption algorithm and the key expansion algorithm; the ciphertext result is generated after the propagation delay through the AES rounds; the AES coprocessor was tested with the NIST example found in AES_NIST.FIPS.197.pdf
